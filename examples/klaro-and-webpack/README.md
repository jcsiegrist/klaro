# Klaro and Webpack

This example shows how to import and use Klaro as a node module via webpack.

To install the dependencies, run

    npm install

To build the distribution files, simply run

    npm run build

To run a development server run

    npm run dev

You can then go to http://localhost:9000 and should see the Klaro consent
manager with a very simple configuration.
